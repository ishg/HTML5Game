Working Title: Bows and Balloons

My first venture into creating a video game. I chose HTML5 to make this game because I like working with the language and wanted to gain more exposure to it. 

The game is made up of a cannon and balloons falling from the sky. You have to shoot the balloons and prevent them from hitting the ground. Every 10 balloons you hit, the level increases, which increases the balloon speed and number. 

A gravity component is also involved, the further the aim reticle is from the cannon turret, the higher the speed of the bullet. If you shoot the bullet too slow, it will fall short of your target. 

Instructions
------------

W and D to move the turret.
Arrow Keys to aim. 
Space Bar to shoot. 


Future Updates
==============

Game features will include cannon power-ups, friendly hot-air balloons, and different types of enemy ballons.

I also plant to implement a future version of the game with KineticJS.
